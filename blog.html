      <div class="collapse-title text-xl font-medium">Why is it important to donate to help less fortunate people?</div>
      <div class="collapse-content">
        <p>Donating helps provide essential resources to people who may not have access to basic needs like food,
          shelter, education, or healthcare. It contributes to reducing poverty, improving communities, and creating a
          more just society. Every contribution can make a big difference in someone's life.</p>

      <div class="collapse-title text-xl font-medium">How can I be sure my donation reaches people who need it most?
      </div>
      <div class="collapse-content">
        <p>Research trusted charities and organizations that have a transparent track record. Look for organizations
          with high ratings on charity watchdog sites and ensure they share detailed reports on how funds are spent.
          This helps confirm that donations are used effectively.</p>

      <div class="collapse-title text-xl font-medium">Can I volunteer instead of donating money?</div>
      <div class="collapse-content">
        <p>Absolutely! Many organizations appreciate volunteers who can donate their time and skills. Volunteering is a
          powerful way to make a difference, whether through helping with food distribution, mentoring, or supporting
          community events.</p>

      <div class="collapse-title text-xl font-medium">How can I encourage others to donate and help the helpless?</div>
      <div class="collapse-content">
        <p>Share stories and experiences that highlight the positive impact of donations, and lead by example. Organize
          fundraising events, join or create social media campaigns, or talk to friends and family about causes you care
          about. Demonstrating how small contributions can make a big difference often inspires others to join in.</p>

      <div class="collapse-title text-xl font-medium"> Can I donate directly to people in need rather than through an
        organization?</div>
      <div class="collapse-content">
        <p>Yes, you can donate directly to people in need, but it's essential to ensure that your help is both
          respectful and empowering. For example, you can support local shelters, provide meals, or even offer
          assistance through community events, always prioritizing privacy and dignity.</p>

      <div class="collapse-title text-xl font-medium">What are some ways I can donate besides giving money?</div>
      <div class="collapse-content">
        <p>Besides monetary donations, you can donate clothing, food, books, toys, or even your time by volunteering.
          Many organizations also welcome skill-based volunteering, where you can contribute expertise in areas like
          teaching, medical care, or job training.</p>
